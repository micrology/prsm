		<title>PRSM: Participatory System Mapper</title>
		<meta
			name="Description"
			content="PRSM enables groups of people, each using their own computer (or tablet) 
		to collaborate in the drawing of a map. They may be sitting around a table, discussing the map as it is 
		created face to face, or working remotely, using video conferencing or the chat feature that is built 
		into the app. Everyone can participate because every edit (creating nodes and links, arranging them 
		and so on) is broadcast to all the other participants as the changes are made (just as Google Docs 
		does for text, for example). When you start PRSM in your browser, a 'room' is created for you in which 
		to draw your network. You can add other users to this room to share the work. Only those with access 
		to the room can see what is being created."

					<h4>
						How the Centre for Research in Social Simulation at the
						University of Surrey handles your personal data
					</h4>
					<p>
						The University of Surrey is the "Data Controller" of
						your personal data. We are registered with the
						Information Commissioner's Office (our notification
						number is Z6346945) and we are committed to ensuring
						that the personal data we process is handled in
						accordance with data protection legislation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Centre for Research in Social Simulation (<a
							href="https://cress.soc.surrey.ac.uk/web/home"
							target="_blank"
							>CRESS</a
						>) and the Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity
						across the Nexus (<a
							href="http://www.cecan.ac.uk/"
							target="_blank"
							>CECAN</a
						>) are both part of the University of Surrey. We have a
						named Data Protection Officer, Suzie Mereweather, who
						can be contacted via
						<a href="mailto:dataprotection@surrey.ac.uk"
							>dataprotection@surrey.ac.uk</a
						>.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of our responsibilities is to tell you about the
						different ways we collect and use your personal data.
						This statement provides details about these uses.
					</p>
					<h4>What information do we collect from you?</h4>
					<p>
						PRSM holds and processes personal data about users when
						you engage with the service. We collect
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							the name you choose to give us when prompted on the
							screen. This stored on your computer or device in
							the browser's local storage (similar to saving a
							'cookie').
						</li>
						<li>
							the IP address you access from (although we don't
							store this)
						</li>
						<li>
							data you enter into the chatbox if you use this. We
							don't expect to collect sensitive personal data
							through the chatbox and ask you to be careful not to
							enter any sensitive personal data.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>
						Why do we collect this information and what do we do
						with it?
					</h4>
					<p>
						We ask you for your name so that we can recognise you if
						you leave and return to the service. We store data
						entered via the chatbox so that you and other
						participants in your 'room' have a record of the
						discussion.
					</p>
					<p>
						All the data we collect is in the University's
						legitimate interest, to provide the PRSM service.
					</p>
					<p>
						The University processes personal data in accordance
						with data protection legislation and its own
						<a
							href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/information-governance/data-protection"
							target="_blank"
							>Data Protection Policy</a
						>.
					</p>
					<h4>How long do we keep your information?</h4>
					<p>
						We keep your personal data only while you or any of the
						other participants in the 'room' maintain an online copy
						of the PRSM map.
					</p>
					<h4>How do we protect your data?</h4>
					<p>
						We take the security of the personal data we hold
						seriously. Details on university wide measures
						surrounding IT security can be found in the principal
						<a
							href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-12/information-security.pdf"
							target="_blank"
							>IT Security Policy</a
						>
						which sets out the definition of, commitment to and
						requirements of Information Technology and Security.
					</p>

					<p>
						We have internal policies and controls in place to try
						to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally
						destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed
						except by our employees in the performance of their
						duties.
					</p>

					<h4>Who do we share your information with?</h4>
					<p>
						Your data is only shared with other participants in your
						'room'. It is stored locally on your own computer and
						also on the service's server, which is located within
						the European Union, in Ireland.
					</p>
					<h4>
						What rights do you have in relation to the way we
						process your data?
					</h4>
					<p>
						As an individual whose data we process (a data subject),
						you have certain rights in relation to the processing.
						You can find detailed information about your rights as a
						data subject on the
						<a
							href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/information-governance/data-protection/guide-data-subject-rights"
							target="_blank"
							>University's webpage</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>You have the right to:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Withdraw your consent in circumstances where we are
							processing your personal data on that basis;
						</li>
						<li>
							Ask us to confirm that your personal data is being
							processed and to access (i.e. have a copy) of that
							data as well as to be provided with supplemental
							information about the processing;
						</li>
						<li>
							request that we rectify any inaccuracies where the
							data we hold on you is inaccurate or incomplete;
						</li>
						<li>Have your data erased by us;</li>
						<li>
							Restrict the processing of your personal data in
							certain ways;
						</li>
						<li>Obtain your personal data for reuse;</li>
						<li>
							Object to certain processing of your personal data.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						To exercise any of these rights, please contact
						<a
							href="mailto:dataprotection@surrey.ac.uk"
							target="_blank"
							>dataprotection@surrey.ac.uk</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have any concerns about the way that we have
						handled your personal data, please contact us as we
						would like to have the opportunity to resolve your
						concerns. If you're still unhappy, you have the right to
						lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's
						Office. Please see their website at:
