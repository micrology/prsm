<li><b>Version 3.0, February 2026</b></li>
<li>
  New: You can now ask an AI to generate a first-draft description of the map, which is displayed in
  the Map Description panel. To open the panel, click on the small grey button on the left edge of
  the map area and click on the 'Sparkle'
  <img src="doc/help/docs/public/images/SparkleIcon-white.png" alt="Sparkle Icon" width="16" />
  icon. The AI will analyze the factors and links in the map and generate a summary of its contents.
  This can be useful for getting an overview of a complex map or for sharing a summary with others
  who may not have time to explore the map in detail.
</li>
<li>
  Similarly, you can ask the AI to generate first-draft descriptions of individual factors and
  links. To do this, click on a factor or link to open its pop-up dialog and click on the 'Sparkle'
  <img src="doc/help/docs/public/images/SparkleIcon.png" alt="Sparkle Icon" width="16" />
  icon there. The AI will analyze the factor and its links and generate a description of it.
</li>
<li>
  The AI-generated descriptions are just a starting point. You can edit and refine them as needed.
  The quality of the descriptions will depend on the complexity of the map and the information it
  contains and are designed to support reflection and refinement — not replace expert judgement. See
  the
  <a href="doc/help/doc_build/manual/AIAssistance.html" target="_blank">AI Assistance</a>
  section of the manual for further details and tips on how to get the best out of this feature.

  As always, feedback on this or on any other feature of PRSM is always welcome, so please get in

</li>
<li><b>Version 2.7, January 2026</b></li>
<li>
  New: PRSM now has an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows developers to interact
  with maps programmatically. See the
  <a href="doc/help/doc_build/manual/Advanced/API.html" target="_blank">API Documentation</a>
  .This interface enables integration with other software systems. For example, there could be a
  program that automatically updates maps based on data from external sources.
</li>
<li>And many minor user interface improvements and performance enhancements.</li>
<li><b>Version 2.6, September 2025</b></li>
<li>
  New: Louvain clustering of factors. This is a method of detecting communities or clusters of
  related factors within a map. See
  <a href="doc/help/doc_build/manual/Analysis.html#louvain-clustering" target="_blank">
    Louvain Clustering
  </a>
  for further details.
</li>
<li>
  Command/Control key combinations can be used instead of the Save (^S), Open (^O) and Undo (^Z)
  buttons.
</li>
<li>
  And formatting changes and bug fixes.
  <hr />
</li>
<li><b>Version 2.5, April 2025</b></li>
<li>
  New: importing and exporting GEXF and GraphML files. These are standard formats for representing
  graphs and networks. You can now import and export PRSM maps in these formats, making it easier to
  share your maps with other applications and tools. See
  <a href="doc/help/doc_build/manual/Files.html" target="_blank">Opening and Saving maps</a>
  .
</li>
<li>
  The Force Atlas 2 layout engine has been tuned to give a more useful layout of complex maps.
</li>
<li>The Settings Factor Styles panel has the number of available styles doubled from 6 to 12.</li>
<li><b>Version 2.4, December 2024</b></li>
<li>
  This version introduces a new type of factor: 'Portals'. A portal factor is a special type of
  factor that links to another map. When you click on a portal factor, the map it links to will open
  in a new browser tab. This useful when, for example, you have several related maps and want to
  move easily between them. It is also useful if you have a high level or abstract map. Portal
  factors on this map can link to more detailed maps that expand on the factors in the high level
  one. See
  <a href="doc/help/doc_build/manual/Cloning.html#linking-one-map-to-another" target="_blank">
    Linking one map to another
  </a>
  for further details.
</li>
<li>
  When opening a map from a file, you can now choose whether the map should replace the existing
  map, or be merged with it. See
  <a href="doc/help/doc_build/manual/Cloning.html#merging-maps" target="_blank">Merging Maps</a>
  .
</li>
<li>
  The colour picker, used to choose the colour of factors, links, background shapes and the map
  background, has been enhanced to control the transparency of the colour. One use of this is that
  if you make the map background transparent and then obtain a high definition image of the map,
  that image will also have a transparent background, which can be helpful when incorporating the
  image into a web page.
</li>
<li>
  When creating a 'read-only' copy of a map, you can choose whether to include a 'Copy map' button
  in the top bar. If you do, viewers cannot change the read only map, but they can create a fully
  editable copy of the map in a new room, displayed in a new browser tab.
</li>
<li>The User Manual has ben reformatted and extended and you can now search it.</li>
<li>
  And bug fixes and security updates.
  <hr />
</li>
<li><b>Version 2.3, May 2024</b></li>
<li>
  The chat feature (the dialog icon in the bottom right corner) has been removed - it was very
  rarely used.
</li>
<li>
  A "minimap" has replaced it. The minimap is a small version of the entire map, displayed in the
  bottom right corner of the screen. It only appears if some parts of the map are not visible within
  the main window. A rectangular outline on the minimap indicates the portion of the map that is
  currently visible in the main window. This helps you to see how the visible section fits within
  the larger map, especially if the map is extensive. You can drag the rectangle on the minimap to
  quickly move the visible area to a different part of the map.
</li>
<li>
  To change your name and your initials shown on the avatar at the top right corner of the map and
  elsewhere, click on the avatar. A dialog will open for you to enter your new name.
</li>
<li>
  To open a PRSM map file (or any of the other types of file that PRSM can read), you can either use
  the Open button or you can now drag a file from your desktop and drop it on the PRSM browser
  window.
  <hr />
</li>
<li><b>Version 2.2, January 2024</b></li>
<li>
  The shapes for individual factors, or for all the factors of the same style, can be resized to be
  relatively larger than other factors. This is done with new sliders included on the pop-up dialogs
  for editing factors and editing factor styles.
</li>
<li>
  You can save a high resolution (8192 x 8192 pixels) image of the map as a Portable Network
  Graphics (.png) file using the Save drop down menu. The image, which is suitable for publication,
  will show the whole map. If, however, you want the image to include just a portion of the map,
  select a factor or factors that you want the image to be centred on before Saving the image. The
  image will include just those factors and the neighbouring ones.
</li>
<li>
  And other enhancements, bug fixes and security updates.
  <hr />
</li>
<li><b>Version 2.1, August 2023</b></li>
<li>
  There is now a panel into which you can write a description or notes about the map as a whole. To
  view the panel, click on the small grey button on the left edge of the map area. While entering or
  editing text, you can use the formatting buttons at the top of the panel: bold, italic, underline,
  as well as change font size, insert images etc. The contents of the panel are shared with other
  participants as you write. Click on the grey button again to put the panel away.
</li>
<li>
  Instead of some factors and links being hidden when using the Analysis features, they are faded
  out, to provide more context around those that are shown.
</li>
