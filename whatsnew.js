<li>This "What's New" panel will pop up whenever a new version of PRSM is released.  You'll only see it once.  Click the Continue button to dismiss it.
<li>The shapes for individual factors, or for all the factors of the same style, can be resized to be relatively larger than other factors.  This is done with new sliders included on the pop-up dialogs for editing factors and editing factor styles.
<li>You can save a high resolution (8192 x 8192 pixels) image of the map as a Portable Network Graphics (.png) file using the Save drop down menu.  The image, which is suitable for publication, will show the whole map.  If, however, you want the image to include just a portion of the map, select a factor or factors that you want the image to be centred on before Saving the image.  The image will include just those factors and the neighbouring ones.
<li>And other enhancements, bug fixes and security updates.
