# Drawing Mode

Switching 'Show drawing layer' ON reveals a group of buttons on the left that enables you to draw shapes, write text, and import images onto the network background.

In drawing mode, the background has a faint square grid to help you line up your drawing.

When you click on some of the drawing buttons, a small dialog box appears that can be used to adjust the drawing tool. For instance, the Line tool, which draws straight lines, has options for the line thickness, line colour and a couple more.

To stop using a tool, either click on another one, or click a second time on that tool's button.

## Moving and modifying objects

Once you have drawn an object (a straight line, or a rectangle, circle, freeform line or marker line), you can select it by clicking on it. The cursor will change to a cross.  Using the mouse (or a stylus of finger) you can  move the object around. To aid in aligning objects, when a side or end is just above or below or to the left or right of another object, red dotted guide lines will appear and the object will momentarily 'stick' on the alignment.

Click on the background to deselect the object.  

After an object has been selected, it is also possible to change its shape or orientation. Drag one of the small dark blue dots (control points) to change the height or width.  Drag the top middle dot to the left or right to rotate the object.

Above the column of buttons is a rectangle outline.  This is a 'handle' for the buttons.  Dragging the handle moves all the buttons together to a new spot in the window - useful if you want to draw where the buttons were.

## The drawing tools

The drawing tools are, in order from top to bottom:

* **Line** draws straight lines.  There are options for the line width, the colour of the line, whether it is solid or dashed, and whether the line can be at any angle or must be either exactly horizontal or vertical.  To use the tool, first adjust the options, for example, to set the colour of the line, then click on the background at the desired start position, drag across to the line end and finally lift the mouse pointer.  When the line has been drawn, you can select it by clicking on it, which redisplays the options and you can then modify the line, for example to make it thicker.
* **Rectangle** The options are the width of the border around the rectangle and its colour, the colour of the inside of the rectangle (the 'fill' colour) and whether it should have rounded or sharp corners.  To draw a rectangle, click where one corner should be, then drag out to where the opposite corner should be and lift the pointer.
* **Text**  Use this tool to add fixed text to the background. The options are the colour and size of the text.  Click on the background to show a text box into which you can type.  You can move the box by dragging on the grey border and expand it by dragging the black square at the bottom right corner.  Click anywhere outside the box to finish.
* **Pencil** draws freehand lines.
* **Marker** draws lines like a marker or highlighter pen.
* **Eraser** removes everything it passes over.
* **Image** Clicking on this tool gives you a file chooser to select an image file (picture) from your computer - JPG, PNG and GIF formats are accepted. When the image has been placed on the background, you can drag it to where you want it, and resize it by dragging on the small black square at the bottom right.  Click anywhere outside the image to fix it to the background.
* **Undo** This tool will undo the effect of the last drawing (e.g. if you have just placed an image on the background, it will remove the image, or if you have drawn a line with the pencil, it will undo that line).  Each click of the Undo button removes a previous drawing.
