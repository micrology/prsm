# Drawing Mode

Switching 'Show drawing layer' ON reveals a group of buttons on the left that enables you to draw shapes, write text, and import images onto the network background.

In drawing mode, the background has a faint square grid to help line up your drawing.  When you draw, you are 'painting' on the background, which means that the shapes and text you apply can only be moved by erasing them and redrawing.

When you click on a drawing button, a small dialog box appears that can be used to adjust the drawing tool. For instance, the Line tool, which draws straight lines, has options for the line thickness and line colour.

To stop using a tool, either click on another one, or click a second time on that tool's button.

The drawing tools are, in order from top to bottom:

* **Line** draws straight lines.  There are options for the line width, the colour of the line, and whether the line must be along the axes, i.e. either horizontal or vertical.  To use the tool, click on the background at the desired start position, drag across to the line end and lift the mouse pointer.
* **Rectangle** The options are the width of the border around the rectangle and its colour, the colour of the inside of the rectangle (the 'fill' colour) and whether it should have rounded or sharp corners.  To draw a rectangle, click where one corner should be, then drag out to where the opposite corner should be and lift the pointer.
* **Text**  Use this tool to add fixed text to the background. The options are the colour and size of the text.  Click on the background to show a text box into which you can type.  You can move the box by dragging on the grey border and expand it by dragging the black square at the bottom right corner.  Click anywhere outside the box to finish.
* **Pencil** draws freehand lines.
* **Marker** draws lines like a marker or highlighter pen.
* **Eraser** removes everything it passes over.
* **Image** Clicking on this tool gives you a file chooser to select an image file (picture) from your computer - JPG, PNG and GIF formats are accepted. When the image has been placed on the background, you can drag it to where you want it, and resize it by dragging on the small black square at the bottom right.  Click anywhere outside the image to fix it to the background.
* **Undo** This tool will undo the effect of the last drawing (e.g. if you have just placed an image on the background, it will remove the image, or if you have drawn a line with the pencil, it will undo that line).  Each click of the Undo button removes a previous drawing.
