# Cloning, Linking and Merging Maps
## Cloning a map
If you click on the **Sharing** button in the top navigation bar, the sharing dialog opens. There are  three buttons on the right.  If you click  the **Clone map** button, a new browser tab will open with the same map but in a new room - any changes made to this new map will *not* appear in the original room.  You can then send the web address to others, confident that they will not disturb the original map.

If you click the **Read only** button, a copy of the map will be made in a new browser tab, but without any of the buttons that would allow one to modify the map. It des however include a **Search** button so that users can search the factors and links in the read only map. You can use the web link of this map to distribute the map to people whom you want to look at the map, but not change it.  

You may not want users to be able to change this read-only map, but nevertheless able to clone the map to another that they can edit.  For example, you might want to put the read only map (or a link to it) on a public website in read only mode, so that users cannot mess with it, but also allow users to create and then modify their own versions of the map.  This can be achieved by checking the box under the **Read only** button before you create the read only copy.  The read only copy will be created in a new tab, as before, but its navigation bar will include a **Copy Map** button,as well as a **Search** button. Clicking on this **Copy Map** button puts the map in a new browser tab in editable mode in a new room.

## Linking a map to another

You may have several related maps that you would like to navigate between.  For example, you may have:
1. Two or more maps each including factors corresponding to related but separate topics
1. A high level map, and two or more much more detailed maps of portions of the network
1. A highly detailed map with many factors, and a much simpler map with just a few of the more important factors.
In each of these examples, it might be useful to switch from one map to another with just a click.  This can be achieved by adding **Portal** factors to the maps.
