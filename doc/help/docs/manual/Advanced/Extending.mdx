# Extending PRSM

{/*<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->*/}
*(The following is intended for developers who want to extend PRSM)*

The program code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/micrology/prsm).  

The javascript (ES6) code in sub-directory `js` is divided into several modules: those that handle the main network pane (`prsm.js`), the background painting functions (`background.js`), editing the styles (`styles.js`) (the default styles are in `samples.js`), the initial tour (`tutorial.js`),  trophic layout (`trophic.js`), clustering (`cluster.js`), the calculation of  betweenness centrality (`betweenness.js`), file saving and reading (`files.js`), the data view (`table.js`), the interface to the AI Large Language Model (`ai.js`) and  shared utility functions (`utils.js` and `merge.js`).  The entry point HTML file that displays in the browser (`prsm.html`) is in the `html` directory.

PRSM uses two important packages: [`yjs`](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) and [`vis-network`](https://visjs.org/).  The former handles the sharing between participants' browsers and the latter draws the network. A few other packages are used for vector graphics for the background (`fabric.js`), and parsing XML file input.  These and commands for checking and packaging the app are listed in `package.json`.

These components are assembled using [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/) and the bundled file is placed in the `dist` directory.  So that users have an easy URL to access (i.e. not needing to include `dist` in the link), there is an `.htaccess` file that rewrites URLs from what the user puts into their browser to the correct location.

To install the code, use `git` to clone the [repo](https://github.com/micrology/prsm) to your local disk and change to the cloned directory.  Then install the required packages with

```bash
        npm install
```

and build the distribution with

```bash
        npm run build
```

Documentation can be found in the `doc` directory including a [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/index.html) index of all functions and methods.

See `package.json` for other npm commands.
