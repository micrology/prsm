# Using the mouse and touch

You can use the following mouse actions (or finger or pencil gestures on a tablet):

* a ***click*** on a factor or a link will select it (the factor or link gains a shadow to show it has been selected, and a message appears in the status bar).  Selected factors can be moved by dragging them (hold down and then move the mouse ) and can be deleted (click on the dustbin/trashcan icon in the navigation bar).
* a ***long click*** on a factor or link extends the selection: that factor or link is added to those already selected.
* a ***control-click*** (hold down the control key and click with the mouse) on a factor or link also extends the selection.
* a ***double-click*** on a factor or link opens an editing dialog so that you can edit its label, change colors and border widths etc. (see [Formatting factors and links](/manual/GettingStarted#formatting-factors-and-links)).
* a ***click*** on the background de-selects all factors and links.
* ***dragging*** the background moves the whole map.
* a ***double-click*** on the background zooms the whole map in or out so that it neatly fits the window.  Any selected factors or links are de-selected.
* holding down the ***shift*** key and dragging shows a selection rectangle - when you release the mouse, all factors in the rectangle are selected.
* holding down the ***control*** key and moving the mouse shows a loupe (a magnifying glass) to see small details of the map.
* holding down the ***option*** or ***ALT*** key and clicking on the background is a shortcut for adding a new factor
* holding down the ***option*** or ***ALT*** key and clicking on a factor is a shortcut for adding a link - the pointer will become a cross and you can then drag from the factor to another factor to create the link.

When editing a label for a Factor or a Link, the ***enter*** key closes the dialog (the same as clicking on `Save`), ***shift*** + ***enter*** adds a newline, and ***esc*** cancels any changes and closes the dialog (the same as clicking the **x**)

The actions that involve holding down a key while clicking with the mouse do not work on touchscreens.
