Sometimes it may be desirable to run PRSM just on one computer working offline.  For these cases, PRSM is also available in \'containerised\' form, which makes it easy to install it on a local server on an intranet, or even on a laptop.  The server can be a Linux, Windows or Apple Mac machine. The following instructions assume that you have some experience with using the command line in a Terminal or Powershell.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Analysing":{"id":"Analysing","title":"Analysing the map","description":"Once you have a map, you may want to examine it for themes and patterns. This is easiest if you examine portions of the map, or \'sub-maps\', one at a time.  As  Barbrook-Johnson and Penn (2021) explain , network analysis can be combined with subjective information to answer a range of questions, as indicated in the table below.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"DataView":{"id":"DataView","title":"Data View","description":"As well as the Map View, PRSM also provides an alternative Data View.  This shows the factors and links in tables like a spreadsheet.  You can make changes in the Data View and the changes to factors and links will immediately be passed over to the Map view.  For some tasks, the Data View is more convenient than the Map, especially when one wants to summarise or make changes to lots of factors or links at the same time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Drawing":{"id":"Drawing","title":"Drawing Mode","description":"Switching \'Switch drawing layer\' ON reveals a group of buttons on the left that enables you to draw shapes, write text, and import images onto the network background.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Examples":{"id":"Examples","title":"Examples","description":"Here are a few examples of what you can do with the app:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Files":{"id":"Files","title":"Files","description":"Reading and Importing maps","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"GettingStarted":{"id":"GettingStarted","title":"Getting started","description":"When the app is started for the first time in your browser, there is an option to type in your name and then to follow a brief tour that shows you the main items on the web page.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Installation":{"id":"Installation","title":"Installation","description":"No installation on your computer is needed.
